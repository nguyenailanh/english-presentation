- WHY
  + to avoid accident(as previous presentation from Minh:...........)
    - The Global Status Report released by WHO this year confirms that road traffic injuries are still a big global health and development problem.
    - statistic
    - traffic
  + bị phạt:
    . lose money
    . lose driving licence temporary: cannot move continously
- HOW
 + vehicle
  - Regular tune-ups and check: daily, weekly and periodically
  - Oil changes
  - Fluid levels
  - Brakes
  - Tire treads and pressure
  - Lights, signals,
  - and wipers, mirrors.
  - buy insurance
 + environment:
  - Driving in a vehicle(cyclo , xe om, taxi, …) instead of using motobike in heavy rain or flooded street?
  -
    +
    +
    +
 + Driver:
  - Obey Viet Nam's traffic rules:
    + Driving Licence: Foreigners are now permitted to drive in Vietnam with an
      International Driving Permit (IDP).
      This must be combined with local insurance for it to be valid.
      In reality on the ground virtually no car-hire agency will provide a car to
      a foreign visitor without including a driver. If you do manage to acquire
      a car without a driver an IDP is technically required.
    + Traffic signs and signals:
     - give examples:
  - Wear a helmet/seat belts
  - Don’t Drink or Take Drugs and Drive:
    + Alcohol and drugs impair:
    + Some medicines can also make drivers drowsy (e.g. cold and flu meds, anti-histamines, etc.
  - Don’t overload
  - Make sure cargo is properly secured
  - Clear vision
  - Slow speed is amost better.
